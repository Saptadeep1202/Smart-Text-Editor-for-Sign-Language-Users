# Smart-Text-Editor-for-Sign-Language-Users
<bv>
• In this project we worked to decode the sign languages used by deaf and mute through fingerspelling.
• The project is done in Python programming language using Numpy, Keras, Tensorflow, Hunspell, PIL (Python Imaging Library), OpenCV etc. libraries.
• The logic used behind the project is of machine learning, is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.
• Here we are able to improve our prediction once after applying two layers of algorithms in which we verify and predict symbols which are identical to each other.
