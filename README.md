# Smart-Text-Editor-for-Sign-Language-Users

This project aims to decode the sign languages used by the deaf and mute community through fingerspelling. It utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize and interpret finger symbols.

## Overview

The project is implemented in Python programming language, leveraging various libraries such as Numpy, Keras, Tensorflow, Hunspell, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and OpenCV.

## Methodology

The core logic of the project is based on machine learning principles, which involves building models that can learn from data to improve performance on specific tasks.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered datasets of finger spelling images representing various symbols used in sign languages.

2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocessed the collected data to enhance its quality and prepare it for training.

3. **Model Development**: Developed machine learning models using Keras and Tensorflow to recognize finger symbols from images.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

5. **Improvement**: Applied two layers of algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy, including verification and prediction of identical symbols.
